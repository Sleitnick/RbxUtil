This is\\nwhere Streamables come into play. Streamables will observe the existence of\\na given instance, and will signal when the instance exists and does not\\nexist.\\n\\nThe API is very simple. Create a Streamable that points to a certain parent\\nand looks for a specific child instance (typically a BasePart). Then, call\\nthe `Observe` method to observe when the instance streams in and out.\\n\\n```lua\\nlocal Streamable = require(packages.Streamable).Streamable\\n\\n-- Models might take a bit to load, but the model instance\\n-- is never removed, thus we can use WaitForChild.\\nlocal model = workspace:WaitForChild(\\"MyModel\\")\\n\\n-- Watch for a specific part in the model:\\nlocal partStreamable = Streamable.new(model, \\"SomePart\\")\\n\\npartStreamable:Observe(function(part, trove)\\n\\tprint(part:GetFullName() .. \\" added\\")\\n\\t-- Run code on the part here.\\n\\t-- Use the trove to manage cleanup when the part goes away.\\n\\ttrove:Add(function()\\n\\t\\t-- General cleanup stuff\\n\\t\\tprint(part.Name .. \\" removed\\")\\n\\tend)\\nend)\\n\\n-- Watch for the PrimaryPart of a model to exist:\\nlocal primaryStreamable = Streamable.primary(model)\\nprimaryStreamable:Observe(function(primary, trove)\\n\\tprint(\\"Model now has a PrimaryPart:\\", primary.Name)\\n\\ttrove:Add(function()\\n\\t\\tprint(\\"Model\'s PrimaryPart has been removed\\")\\n\\tend)\\nend)\\n\\n-- At any given point, accessing the Instance field will\\n-- reference the observed part, if it exists:\\nif partStreamable.Instance then\\n\\tprint(\\"Streamable has its instance:\\", partStreamable.Instance)\\nend\\n\\n-- When/if done, call Destroy on the streamable, which will\\n-- also clean up any observers:\\npartStreamable:Destroy()\\nprimaryStreamable:Destroy()\\n```\\n\\nFor more information on the mechanics of how StreamingEnabled works\\nand what sort of behavior to expect, see the\\n[Content Streaming](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/content-streaming#technical-behavior)\\npage. It is important to understand that only BaseParts and their descendants are streamed in/out,\\nwhereas other instances are loaded during the initial client load. It is also important to understand\\nthat streaming only occurs on the client.
