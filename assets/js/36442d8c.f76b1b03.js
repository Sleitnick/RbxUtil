For every shake,\\nsimply create a shake instance by calling `Shake.new()`. From\\nthere, configure the shake however desired.

However, only one shake\\noperation per instance can be running. If more than one is needed\\nof the same configuration, simply call `shake:Clone()` to duplicate\\nit.\\n\\nExample of a simple camera shake:\\n```lua\\nlocal priority = Enum.RenderPriority.Last.Value\\n\\nlocal shake = Shake.new()\\nshake.FadeInTime = 0\\nshake.Frequency = 0.1\\nshake.Amplitude = 5\\nshake.RotationInfluence = Vector3.new(0.1, 0.1, 0.1)\\n\\nshake:Start()\\nshake:BindToRenderStep(Shake.NextRenderName(), priority, function(pos, rot, isDone)\\n\\tcamera.CFrame *= CFrame.new(pos) * CFrame.Angles(rot.X, rot.Y, rot.Z)\\nend)\\n```\\n\\nShakes will automatically stop once the shake has been completed.
